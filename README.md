# geostyler-wfs-parser

[GeoStyler](https://github.com/terrestris/geostyler/) Data Parser implementation for Web Feature Services (WFS)

Currently, WFS service must support `application/json` as outputFormat and its application server must be configured to send CORS headers (only needed if WFS Service is not located on the same origin as the component using this parser)

Work in progress, stay tuned...
